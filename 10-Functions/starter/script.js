Let's build a simple poll app!

A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

Here are your tasks:

1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

//By telling javascript we explicitly what the this keyword should look like (call apply and find)

//After
document

//Partial application (means we can preset parameters)
const addTax = (rate, value) => value + value * rate;

//In this case we dont even care about the this keyword (because we will preset the rate so it always uses that rate)
//usually the first word in the bind is what the this keyword points towards but in this case we dont care about that because it is preset

//So the above addVat essentially does the following: addVat value => value + value * 0.23;

//The order is important if you want to preset the rate it has to be the first parameter so you can use null because we dont care about the this keyword in this case

//Challenge create the above but with a function that returns a function
