    <h1>BOSTON CELTICS PRACTICE PAGE</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.nba.com/celtics/">The Boston Celtics</a> (/ˈsɛltɪks/ SEL-tiks) are an American professional
      basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National
      Basketball Association <span class="highlight">(NBA)</span> as a member of the league's Eastern
      Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's
      original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden,
      which they share with the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      The Celtics are regarded as one of the most successful basketball teams in NBA
      history; The franchise is tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA
      Championships won with 17 <span class="highlight">(accounting for 23.6 percent of all NBA
      championships since the league's founding)</span> and currently holds the record
      for the most recorded wins of any NBA team.
    <p>
      The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, which was heavily highlighted
      throughout the 1960s and 1980s. During the two teams' many match-ups in
      the 1980s, the Celtics' star, Larry Bird, and the Lakers' star, Magic
      Johnson, had an ongoing feud. The franchise has played the Lakers a record
      12 times in the NBA Finals <span class="highlight">(including their most recent appearances in
      2008 and 2010)</span>, of which the Celtics have won nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four Celtics players <span class="highlight">(Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird)</span> have won the
      NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP
      awards. Both the nickname "Celtics" and their mascot "Lucky the
      Leprechaun" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population, and
      also to the Original Celtics, a marquee team prior to the NBA.
